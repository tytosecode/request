## Project Proposal: Enhanced Code Security through LLM-Based Analysis

1. *Questions or Problems to Address:*
   - Do I inherit malicious code through any of my direct or transitive dependencies?
   - Do I have logic vulnerabilities in my code?
   - Out of the CVEs assigned to my dependencies, what are actually being called by my code?

2. *Methodologies and Approaches:*
   - Leveraging a cutting-edge LLM (Large Language Model) for code analysis to detect vulnerabilities and threats.
   - Employing advanced machine learning techniques to train the model on vast amounts of code data, enabling it to recognize patterns and anomalies.
   - Integrating the LLM-based analysis into existing code review processes or development environments.
   - Conducting continuous scanning of code repositories and real-time analysis during the development and deployment phases.
   - Utilizing rule-based systems and heuristics to augment the LLM-based analysis and enhance accuracy.

3. *Expected Results:*
   - Improved detection and prevention of malicious code, logic vulnerabilities, and exploitable CVEs through code analysis alone.
   - Real-time identification of emerging threats, providing proactive defense against potential risks to software systems.
   - Seamless integration into existing development workflows, minimizing disruption and facilitating adoption.

By implementing this project, we aim to address the critical challenges of code security by leveraging LLM-based analysis. We anticipate significant improvements in detecting vulnerabilities and ensuring code integrity, leading to robust software systems with minimized security risks.
